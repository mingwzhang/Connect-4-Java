**Connect 4 Java**

This is a text-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game in Java, created as a college project back when I was new to coding.

**How to Play** 

Compile: 
Compile the Connect4.java file.  

Run: 
Run the compiled file to start the game.

Gameplay: 
Players take turns to drop either a red or yellow disk into one of the columns of the board. The first player to connect four of their disks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
