# Connect 4 Java

This is a text-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game in Java, created as a college project back when I was new to coding.

## How to Play

1. **Compile**: Compile the `Connect4.java` file.
2. **Run**: Run the compiled file to start the game.
3. **Gameplay**: Players take turns to drop either a red or yellow disk into one of the columns of the board. The first player to connect four of their disks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
